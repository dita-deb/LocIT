Alright, so I'm struggling with the actual downloading of the OpenCV and importing cv2. I'm going to have to look into why the Raspberry Pi doesn't recognize the picam mod3 wide as an actual camera.

Additionally, I need to find a way to connect the servo motor to the two different picams running on individual Pi's.
