# Facial Recognition on VSCode
## Milestone #1 Demo

### Overview:
This folder contains the code used for facial recognition tasks, specifically capturing, training, and recognizing faces.

### Week 6 Code:
#### File Descriptions:
Face_taker.py: Captures images of the target individual and stores them in the dataset for later use in training the model.

Face_train.py: Trains the facial recognition model using the images captured in Face_taker.py, allowing the system to recognize the individualâ€™s face.

face_recognizer.py: Runs the trained facial recognition model, identifying individuals from the dataset in real-time or from new images.

names.json: Stores a mapping between each individual's name and their corresponding image data in the dataset.

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: A pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier that detects facial features (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) to identify and classify faces for recognition.
