# Facial Recognition on VSCode
## Milestone #1 Demo

### Overview:
This folder contains the code used for facial recognition tasks, specifically capturing, training, and recognizing faces.

### Week 6 Code:
#### File Descriptions:
Face_taker.py: Captures images of the target individual and stores them in the dataset for later use in training the model.

Face_train.py: Trains the facial recognition model using the images captured in Face_taker.py, allowing the system to recognize the individualâ€™s face.

face_recognizer.py: Runs the trained facial recognition model, identifying individuals from the dataset in real-time or from new images.

names.json: Stores a mapping between each individual's name and their corresponding image data in the dataset.

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml: A pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier that detects facial features (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) to identify and classify faces for recognition.

This video is from when the model was not working and giving an error when tracking multiple faces to the same name.
